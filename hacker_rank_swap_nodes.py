"""
A binary tree is a tree which is characterized by one of the following properties:

o It can be empty (null).
o It contains a root node only.
o It contains a root node with a left subtree, a right subtree, or both. These subtrees are also binary trees.

In-order traversal is performed as

1. Traverse the left subtree.
2. Visit root.
3. Traverse the right subtree.

For this in-order traversal, start from the left child of the root node and keep exploring the left subtree
until you reach a leaf. When you reach a leaf, back up to its parent, check for a right child and visit it
if there is one. If there is not a child, you've explored its left and right subtrees fully. If there is a
right child, traverse its left subtree then its right in the same manner. Keep doing this until you have
traversed the entire tree. You will only store the values of a node as you visit when one of the following 
is true:

o it is the first node visited, the first time visited
o it is a leaf, should only be visited once
o all of its subtrees have been explored, should only be visited once while this is true
o it is the root of the tree, the first time visited

Swapping: Swapping subtrees of a node means that if initially node has left subtree L and right subtree R, 
then after swapping, the left subtree will be R and the right subtree, L.

For example, in the following tree, we swap children of node 1.

                                Depth
    1               1            [1]
   / \             / \
  2   3     ->    3   2          [2]
   \   \           \   \
    4   5           5   4        [3]

In-order traversal of left tree is 2 4 1 3 5 and of right tree is 3 5 1 2 4.

Swap operation:

We define depth of a node as follows:

o The root node is at depth 1.
o If the depth of the parent node is d, then the depth of current node will be d+1.

Given a tree and an integer, k, in one operation, we need to swap the subtrees of all the nodes at each depth h,
where h âˆˆ [k, 2k, 3k,...]. In other words, if h is a multiple of k, swap the left and right subtrees of that level.

You are given a tree of n nodes where nodes are indexed from [1..n] and it is rooted at 1. You have to perform t 
swap operations on it, and after each swap operation print the in-order traversal of the current state of the tree.

Function Description

Complete the swapNodes function in the editor below. It should return a two-dimensional array where each element 
is an array of integers representing the node indices of an in-order traversal after a swap operation.

swapNodes has the following parameter(s):
- indexes: an array of integers representing index values of each , beginning with , the first element, as the root.
- queries: an array of integers, each representing a  value.

Input Format

The first line contains n, number of nodes in the tree.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers, a b, where a is the index of left child, and b is the index of 
right child of ith node.

Note: -1 is used to represent a null node.

The next line contains an integer, t, the size of queries.
Each of the next t lines contains an integer queries[i], each being a value k.

Output Format

For each k, perform the swap operation and store the indices of your in-order traversal to your result array.
After all swap operations have been performed, return your result array for printing.

Constraints

o 1 <= n <= 1024
o 1 <= t <= 100
o 1 <= k <= n
o Either a == -1 or 2 <= a <= n 
o Either b == -1 or 2 <= b <= n 
o The index of a non-null child will always be greater than that of its parent.

Explanation 0

As nodes 2 and 3 have no children, swapping will not have any effect on them. We only have to swap the child 
nodes of the root node.

    1   [s]       1    [s]       1   
   / \      ->   / \        ->  / \  
  2   3 [s]     3   2  [s]     2   3

Note: [s] indicates that a swap operation is done at this depth.
